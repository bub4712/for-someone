        <p>Dear macchiato,</p>
        <p>I would like to use this opportunity to let you know how much you mean to me :3 From our daily shared laughter to the generous times that you've been there for me, you have made my life abundantly delightful in so many ways.</p>
        <p>Just you and your little texts scattered throughout the day since you came back have been a constant source of so much support and happiness, and i'm seriously so so grateful for all the memories we've created together.</p>
        <p>Damn you prolly don't even know how much better you make my day T-T 
            hearing the notification sound and hoping it's from you.</p>
        <p>What have you done to me bijjj </p>

        <p>You'll be starting uni this year, which is a pretty big next step in your life, so i wish you all the best and hope that you'll have lots of fun and amazing experiences! maybe it'll all be very easy or maybe very hard,,, just know that i'll always be there, glad to be a supportive pillar (❁´◡`❁)</p>
        <p>May you find people who cherish you and whom you cherish back... May you never lose your sunny countenance and your freakishly adorable humour... And may you always emerge victorious, never losing your spirit, and continue to fight hard, no matter the challenges you face.</p>
        <p>Happy Birthday once again! Cheers to (hopefully) many more years of friendship and wonderful memories.</p>
        <p>With all my love and best wishes,</p>
        <p>-bug</p>
